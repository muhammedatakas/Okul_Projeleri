There is so much that’s deeply disturbing about the latest controversial study about anti-depressant drugs which has just been published online in the journal, Public Library of Science (Medicine).
In this study, Professor Irving Kirsch from the University of Hull and an international team of colleagues managed to get hold of all the pre-marketing studies – all the studies, both published and unpublished – for 4 of the most popular SSRI anti-depressant drugs, what you might call, the creme de la creme of anti-depressants because these drugs account for the overwhelming proportion of anti-depressant prescriptions.
And their conclusion will stun some people (but not others, me, among the latter): overall, these drugs are only slightly better than placebos at eliminating or even controlling depression in the vast majority of people for whom they are prescribed, namely the mildly to moderately depressed (the authors conclude the drugs are effective in the “most severely” depressed but even there they apply some caveats to the use of these meds).
Or, to quote Professor Kirsch, who has put this as succinctly as one can put it: “Given these results, there seems to be little reason to prescribe antidepressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients, unless alternative treatments have failed to provide a benefit.”
So why is this conclusion so disturbing?
First, of course, because so many people have come to rely on these drugs, and if they’re now to be told that the drugs don’t actually work, what will happen to their symptoms (which presumably have been somewhat controlled in many of them, if only, as this study argues, mostly as a placebo effect, but an effect that will now be removed for them?)
So it must be said up front that even if these drugs are not nearly as effective as they’re touted to be, long-standing clinical observation argues that they are still somewhat effective in many people, so anyone taking such a drug and feeling better as a consequence should certainly continue to do so.
These results do argue, however, for my long-standing proposition, namely, that for mild-to-moderate depression, chemical intervention should be the last treatment resorted to, not the first, as is far too often the case.
Further, this study also strongly encourages anyone with depression to fervently pursue other modalities of treatment, especially those with a much lower risk of side effects or comp0lications, therapies such as exercise, which has been shown in many studies to be highly effective therapy for mild-to-moderate depression, as well as “talk therapy, too, of course, which is often discounted by medical practitioners but which is highly effective for many people.
