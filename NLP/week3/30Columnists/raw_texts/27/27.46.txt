There’s no escaping it: we have Celebrex on our pre-Christmas minds. And as if to underscore that there’s absolutely no getting away from Celebrex and its cousins, here’s yet another update on Celebrex, an anti-inflammatory known as a Cox 2 inhibitor that was recently shown in a large (US) National Institutes of Health study to increase the risk of heart attack and strokes by a factor of 3 (when used in huge doses). 
This led the NIH to promptly terminate this study prematurely. 
First, in another study also run by the NIH and which was also terminated early, Celebrex did not raise the risk of heart attack or stroke even when used in very large doses, although another drug, naproxen, which is an anti-inflammatory known as a Cox 1 inhibitor, did. 
So what’s up? 
Clearly, no one knows, but it’s the usual: we need more data and more studies. 
Does that mean, though, that you can go back on Celebrex if you need it, even in very high doses? 
Well, no. 
I would still counsel caution in resuming my use of Celebrex, if I were you, especially if you have other risks of heart disease (and how many of us over the age of 50 don’t have even one extra risk) unless you have no option. 
Which brings me to the 2nd item about Celebrex that I wanted to flag for you. 
British drug regulators have warned British patients to stop taking all Cox inhibitors if they have heart disease. 
And what should they do instead, you wonder? 
“Switch to an alternative as soon as is convenient”, which is good advice, I suppose, but only so long as there is an alternative. 
Which brings us round again to item number one. 
You see, the Brits issued that directive the day before the US FDA revealed that news about, naproxen, namely, that it led to a raised risk of heart attack and stroke compared to placebo and compared to Celebrex. 
Hey, who said it was easy being a health regulator?
