I know that like the Eveready bunny I keep on going and going although in my case, it’s more like going on and going on and going on about the benefits of exercise for a healthier life, but I really can’t help it, because the more medical studies I read, the more convinced I become that exercise – or more accurately, I think, regular physical activity - is the most magic potion we have for not only staying alive longer and for staving off illness while we are alive, but as important, exercise is also a magic potion for growing old in a more healthy fashion.

And to underline that last part – about growing old in a healthier manner – one of the things we dread about getting older, and for most of us it’s probably our biggest fear of aging, is the threat of losing our cognitive function, our memories, our ability to make decisions, our ability to analyze events and threats, most simply, our ability to continue being who we are.

And to that end, the data is pretty overwhelming: the more active you are, the more physical exercise you do in your younger years, that is, before you get old, the better your brain function remains in old age, and the longer you hang on to whatever brain function you have left as you rumble thorugh your remaining years.

To underline that conclusion, in a recent study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine the researchers claimed that they looked at all the studies out there about the benefits of exercise on the brain, and the authors concluded that regular exercise increases the “speed and sharpness of thought”, slows the seemingly inevitable rate of decrease in volume of brain tissue with age, and helps brain function in all the ways that count. 

In fact, according to the authors, exercise not only slows normal deterioration in brain function (some of which is clearly inevitable as the years go by), but exercise may actually even reverse some of these negative effects. 

Hey, dudes, wanna keep your brain intact as you age? 

Do more exercise. 


Period.
