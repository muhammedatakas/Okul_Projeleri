The good news is that there is now one less thing to worry about – maybe.

In a world dominated by the latest medical scare-de-jour (say hello to BPA, that chemical found in plastic bottles which has not been banned in Canada for use in baby bottles), I’ll bet most of you don’t remember the chemical acrylamide, so let me remind you that about 4 or 5 years ago, acrylamide was the chemical that everyone was wary of because of a few (poor) studies linkingit to a higher incidence of cancer, especially cancers of the GI tract.

Acrylamide is something that’s produced when certain foods are cooked at high temperatures, and the problem is that so many of the things you like to eat that are cooked at higher temperatures – potatoes (especially French fries), bread, pastries, even coffee – contain acrylamide, so any hint of a link with cancer is cause for concern.

But according to a recent Dutch study update in the Journal of Nutrition,  “No association was observed between dietary acrylamide intake and risk of cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, which in plain old English means, it’s very unlikely that acrylamide causes cancer of the GI tract, great news for all French fries and coffee fans like me.

You can bet, though, that this will not be the last word on acrylamide, and as sure as the feds hand out research grants, you can be sure there will soon be another study that contradicts the claims in this one.
