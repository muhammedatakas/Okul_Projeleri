The headlines over a recent health story published in the journal, Chest, (and which, by the way, dealt with studies that originated from the University of British Columbia), were seemingly unanimous: the early use of antibiotics in kids increases the risk of later asthma in those kids.
To be fair, the headlines merely implied that based on these studies, babies who get antibiotics in the first year of life are also more likely to end up with asthma, they didn’t actually firmly state that this was a clear one-way effect.
But since most people don’t read beyond paragraph 2 in a medical story, that’s the inevitable conclusion the readers of these articles would have been left with, that is, that giving an antibiotic to a baby under the age of 1 year increases that baby’s risk of ending up with asthma as a direct consequence of using that antibiotic.
And indeed, that might actually be true because in these two studies that were just published, the researchers reviewed several other studies on the use of antibiotics in young kids (they ended up including reviews of more than 40,000 kids overall) and found that, yes, kids who get antibiotics under the age of 1 are indeed twice as likely to end up with asthma as are kids who don’t get antibiotics at such a young age, and further, the more antibiotics they get (if the young child has, say, 2 or more infections that are treated with antibiotics), the higher is their risk of eventual asthma.
Does that mean, though, that the antibiotics cause the asthma, as most readers of these stories would conclude?
Not at all.
In fact, even the authors of the study were adamant in pointing out that although that was the likely conclusion, namely, that early use of antibiotics increases the risk of later asthma, there is no way in such studies to rule out the other clear possibility, that is, that infants more prone to asthma in the first place are more likely than other kids to end up with kind of infections that necessitate the use of antibiotics.
In other words, what these studies can’t do is to tell us which is the horse and which is the cart: does asthma lead to a higher use of antibiotics or does the use of antibiotics lead to a higher risk of asthma?
That said, we clearly overuse antibiotics, especially in kids, and although antibiotics are generally benign medications, there are significant and severe potential downsides and risks to their use, and we should do – we must do – a better job of using such powerful drugs only when absolutely necessary, and not just in case they may be necessary.
