The injectable contraceptive, Depo-provera, is a very useful choice for many women, particularly those who can’t or won’t tolerate other forms of contraception. Depo-provera (DP) is given as an injection 4 times a year and provides a very high rate of protection against pregnancy. 
But there may be a cost in using DP. 
According to an intriguing but small study from the US, women who used DP were more likely to come down with an STD than women who used oral contraception or women who used condoms. 
This has led the researchers conclude that perhaps DP raises the risk of STD. 
However, before jumping to that conclusion, it must be noted that there are problems with this study: 1) the numbers are small (800 women in all, only 45 of whom developed an STD), and 2) although the researchers tried hard to account for this, it is difficult to account for all the potential differences among women who choose particular kinds of birth control. 
In other words, there may be some difference (the type of partenrs they choose, for example) between women who choose DP and women who choose some othe form of birth control, and it may be those differences (and not their particular form of birth control) that present DP women with a higher risk of getting and STD. 
Whatever the final anser is, though, it is still clear that women who use DP should monitor themselves very carefully for STDs, although I suppose you could say that’s true for all women who are sexually active, no matter what form of birth control they use.
