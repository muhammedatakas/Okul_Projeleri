A study published a while ago in the online edition of the journal Neurology stirred a lot of media attention because it concludes that the wider your waist at midlife, the greater your risk of dementia.

In this study, the researchers looked at several thousand people who had been examined 40 years before for the famous ongoing Framingham Study, and found that the more weight a person packed around his middle, the higher his eventual risk of dementia.

More specifically, the fattest (in the middle) people had roughly 3 times the risk of developing dementia comapred to the thinnest people.

Why?

No one knows, of course, but readers of this blog will not be surprised at all at this link because I have pointed out many, many times that the evidence is pretty strong that the risk factors for dementia are very similar if not identical to the risk factors that we long ago established for most of the other chronic diseases of aging, namely Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and many forms of cancer.
