“Huh”, I said in my usual articulate manner when I saw that particular headline over a medical story that came across my computer.

And I’m sure many of you are saying the same things.

After all, aren’t marathons notorious for every few months killing 1 or 2 otherwise healthy people who reportedly collapse at the end of some of these races for no other reason than that they just really strained themselves by their marathon effort?

Yes, that’s true, say these authors from the University of Toronto who published their analysis in the British Medical Journal – every year a few marathoners die as a direct result of trying to run a marathon.

But the really interesting thing, these authors aver, is that the road closures that marathons entail actually save a lot of lives.

Specifically, these authors found that 26 marathoners have died in the US over the past 30 years from running (most of them presumably through a sudden fatal change in cardiac rhythm leading to a heart stoppage), but road closures for the time the marathon was run prevented, they say, 46 motor vehicle accidents.

I’m not sure how you’re supposed to balance that out, though, or what we’re supposed to do with that kind of data.

What do you tell the families of the marathoners who died, for example?

That, hey, we’re sorry for your loss, but just think of the other lives we’ve saved in the meantime.

And do health authorities try to encourage more people to participate in marathons so that they can then close more roads as a consequence of larger numbers of people entering these ridiculous distance races?

Bottom line: if you love to run long and far, good for you, but let’s not try to hide the fact that a few people who are doing that will suffer a medical catastrophe as a consequence.
