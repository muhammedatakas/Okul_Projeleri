No matter what we look at – calcium supplements in adults to maintain bone strength, vitamin supplements to help ward off heart disease and cancer, fish oil supplements to do likewise – we discover that nothing ever beats the source.
That is, no supplement, no vitamin, no food ingredient is ever as good as eating foods that are loaded with whatever supplement it is that you are touting.
So it shouldn’t really come as a surprise that a thorough review of calcium supplementation in kids to help build their bones found – ta tum – they don’t work.
In this review of several previous studies, the objective people at the Cochrane Library determined that kids who took calcium supplement had no stronger bones (as measured by ultrasound) than kids who got their calcium from food, even when the former kids were taking extra-large doses of the supplements.
Why no effect from the supplements?
Lots of potential reasons.
First, to get calcium into bones, it probably has to be eaten with the protein wrap that comes naturally in the form of fruits, veggies, and particularly dairy products.
Otherwise, most of the calcium that’s taken in is simply not absorbed.
Second, we know in adults that calcium without vitamin D is pretty useless, and perhaps that’s the problem in kids, too.
Third, to build strong bones, kids may not need all that much calcium in the first place so long as they’re also getting lots of weight-bearing exercise, and perhaps kids who eat foods containing lots of calcium tend to be healthier (more active) than kids whose parents feel need calcium supplements fed to them.
Whatever the reason, the bottom line for kids is the same as the bottom line for adults: 1) eat what you need and don’t rely on supplements to make up for any perceived deficiencies, and 2) there is no magic chemical or food or food ingredient so the best plan is to eat a varied diet (in moderate proportions, of course) of everything and not to go stressing one ingredient over others.
