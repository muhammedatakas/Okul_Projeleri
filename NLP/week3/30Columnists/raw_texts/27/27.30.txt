Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest-growing cancers in developed countries.
And as usual, no one really knows why, although most experts are fingering the coincidental rise in cases of esophageal reflux disease or GERD over the last few years in North America as well as the similar steep climb in cases of obesity.
That is, in plain English, most experts figure that GERD and obesity are triggering a dramatic rise in esophageal cancer, although before everyone who has a bit of reflux starts gulping hard and worrying that he’s well on his way to getting esophageal cancer, be aware that the overwhelming proportion of people with GERD do not get esophageal cancer.
That’s the good news.
The bad news is that some GERD sufferers do end up with cancer of the esophagus, and the even worse news is that up to very recent times, the prognosis for esophageal cancer has been pretty bad, in large part because it’s been a very hard cancer to diagnose until the cancer is well advanced.
Why?
Because the symptoms are usually mild until the cancer has been there a long time.
The symptoms of esophageal cancer are generally listed as difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, and pain, but these symptoms really only hit hard when cancer is very advanced.
So the interesting news is that according to a recent small study (99 patients) from an Irish surgeon, a large number of people with esophageal in his survey claim they also suffered from “hiccup attacks” as a “predominant” symptom of esophageal cancer.
Why hiccups would accompany esophageal cancer is still a mystery, but hey, if you develop frequent bouts of hiccups and you also have reflux and you’re also overweight, it might be worth looking down your esophagus.
Most of the time, happily, there won’t be a problem.
But if there is something brewing there, hey, the earlier it’s caught, the better
