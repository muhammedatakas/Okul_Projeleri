Gary Small is a terrific brain researcher from California (where they have lots of odd brains to study, of course), and in the past, he’s done some excellent work showing that most of those lifestyle recommendations we make to help you ward off chronic disease, especially exercise, are also very effective at helping maintain brain function.

In this latest study published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, Small and his lab turned their attention to another factor that might help ameliorate slowing brain function with age: computer use, and more specifically, surfing the net, and their observation is quite interesting - surfing the net is healthy for your brain, but way more so if you’re already used to doing it.

In this study using functional MRIs on healthy volunteers, the researchers found that reading and surfing the net both turned on certain parts of the brain, the same parts in fact, which means that contrary to what your mother might have tried to tell you (or in my case, what my wife tells me constantly), spending time on the net does involve using your brain, and it may even be as good for brain function as reading is.

So there’s more to this, and here’s the really neat part: when they tested chronic net surfers, people like me, I guess, who spend lots of time on the net, they found that these nerds used parts of the brain that the surfing-naive dudes didn’t use.

In other words, people who use the internet lots develop brain areas that you don’t generally use otherwise.

I don’t believe, however, that this is meant to apply surfing for porn or gambling sites, at least I sincerely hope not.
