Perhaps the most interesting consistent finding over the last few years in the complex world of dementia research is that contrary to what many people still think, the loss of brain function with age is not at all inevitable. In fact, you can do a terrific amount to prevent most forms of dementia, and you can greatly improve the chances that you will live to a grand old age and still be able to distinguish the cocoa from the cola. 
And what is it you should be doing to keep your memory and other cognitive functions in fighting trim? 
Exactly the same things you should be doing to maintain a health heart: watch your weight (and I don’t mean watching it go up) so that you don’t end up with diabetes, keeping blood cholesterol at healthy levels, doing regular exercise, keeping blood pressure as low as you can get it, and not smoking. 
And oh yes, although this is much more controversial, I think a little bit of regular wine intake can’t hurt, either. 
The latest proof that all these preventive measures actually help the brain comes from a study published in the journal, Neurology, which followed nearly 9,000 middle-aged (ages 40-44) people for about 30 years. 
For every risk factor these people had, the risk of dementia went up by 27 %, and the more risk factors a person had in this study, the worse their outcome, although some risk factors were much worse for the brain than others. 
Thus, diabetes increased the risk of dementia by roughly 50 %, while high blood pressure increased the risk by 24 %. 

Bottom line: if you’re a typical 45-year-old male who figures you’re too busy, too tired, too healthy still, too young (take your pick of excuses) to get into shape and that you can delay doing something about your health, oh, until you’re about the age where you can join the Golden Age Club to walk around the mall, you better think again, mate. 
The time to do something for your brain is actually now.
