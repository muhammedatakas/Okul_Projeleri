In some of the last few items on my Global TV blog site, I’ve told you about depressing news for kids and for middle-aged adults that came from studies presented at the recently-concluded annual meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans, so not to leave you feeling left out if you’re older than that, there was a also some depressing heart news for seniors, too, the most noteworthy of which was a study about the costs to the heart from not getting enough sleep.

Now, if you’re not there yet, you may think that every senior gets enough sleep because, it always seems to younger folks, seniors are forever dozing off: at the park, at the dinner table, on the couch, even in line.

But the reason some seniors do that – and certainly this is not true for all seniors, some of whom are way more with it and aware than people half their age – is that they are actually not getting enough good quality sleep at night, which according to a study from Japan, might also jeopardize their healthy by significantly raising their risk of heart attacks if they also have high blood pressure, a condition that afflicts a great many seniors.

In this study, which was also published coincidentally in the Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers  followed 1200 Japanese seniors with high blood pressure, and found that those seniors who got less than 7 ½ hours sleep a night had over twice the risk of suffering a heart attack of stroke compared to seniors who got enough sleep, an effect that was particularly pronounced in those seniors whose high blood pressure did not dip during the night, which is what blood pressure is supposed to do while you’re asleep.
