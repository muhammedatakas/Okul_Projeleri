An intriguing report that will soon be published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology is a look at 30-years’ worth of studies on the effect that stress might have on the heart and the conclusion of the author, a well-known psychologist, seems to be, if you pardon the term, inconclusive, by which I mean that according to this reviewer at least, the link between heart disease and stress is not nearly as clear as most of us believe is the case.

It all has to do with the way we determine the effects of stress in humans which can really only be done from observational or epidemiological studies, most of which are done by taking a group of people and following them for a few years, and then after that period of time, trying to extract some of the factors that have made a difference in the health outcomes that are found.

It’s, of course, hard enough in large observational studies to isolate specific factors in the first place, but the main difficulty comes from one of the major (and often insoluble) questions that always plagues observational or epidemiological studies: when two phenomena happen together in the same people, when they are said to be linked, as for example, when we say that say stress is linked to more heart disease, how can you really tell which effect is the cause and which effect is the result, that is, does stress lead to heart disease or does early heart disease (perhaps at a sub-clinical or not-yet-diagnosed level) somehow increase stress levels.

It’s not simple to do, which is why there is always so much argument about epidemiological findings: for example, do people who exercise live longer or do people who are programmed to live longer do more exercise?

Do people who live healthier lifestyles end up with less dementia, or do people who are at lower risk of dementia in the first place end up living healthier lifestyles?

And the same problem plagues studies that link stress to any “bad” health outcome, even whether stress raises the risk of heart disease, although I think (and this review seems to agree) the weight of evidence is that it does, although clearly it has a much worse effect in some people than in others.

One other interesting observation made by this reviewer is his feeling that the evidence indicates that lowering stress levels through some form of treatment also lowers the risk of heart disease, something that makes sense but which I think is not nearly as provable as we’d like it to be, although I do believe that self-treatment – exercise, lowering stress levels, more sleep – does work.
