The good news is that regularly eating chocolate may help keep your blood pressure down.
The bad news is that these researchers only want you to eat a wee bit of chocolate, a very, very wee bit.
So, first, the good news. In a tiny study (44 participants) that has received an amazing amount of coverage (slow news week, not to mention that we love to report on what we love to eat), eating a small amount (6 gm) of dark chocolate every day led a to a drop in systolic blood pressure of roughly 3 mm and a drop in diastolic BP of roughly 2 mm, and before you scoff that this is a paltry drop, let me tell you that that’s pretty close to the best drop in BP you ever get with dietary manipulation or exercise.
In fact, statistically, the experts claim, this kind of BP drop would lead to a 4 % drop in mortality in a large population that undertook this dietary change.
But, there’s the ubiquitous but, and it starts with your butt.
Thus, this is a tiny amount of chocolate (30 calories), and any more than that ingested regularly, the experts say, would lead to a gain in weight (chocolate is loaded with fat, albeit “good” fat, and sugar, not to mention caffeine) that would more than offset the benefit in blood pressure.
Second, thec study only went on for 18 weeks, so we have no idea if that benefit would fall off after several months, as our bodies adapted to the regular intake.|
Third, this study involved only very good quality dark choco, not that milk chocolate stuff that most people seem to prefer but which is really way more candy than anti-oxidant.
But, that said, hey, if you ask me, a bit of chocolate is a great way to end a meal, even two or three times a day, so long as you’re doing all those other things I have advised you to do to control your BP.
And you are doing all those other things, aren’t you?
