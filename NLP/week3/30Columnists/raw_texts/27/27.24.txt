The secret’s out. 

No, not that Secret, which is the most non-sensical thing to be hyped by Oprah (and the rest of the gullible media) since the last thing Oprah hyped. 

Rather, the secret that’s out that I’m referring to is the one about how you can get your spouse to live a healthier lifestyle, like if you want him to quit smoking, for example, or looking at how far down his torso he now has to hitch his belt, to start an exercise programme. 

And that secret is? 

Well, it’s no secret at all, of course, but the best way to get someone to change is to . . . make the same change yourself. 

In a study that lasted 6 years and looked at 6000 plus American adults with unhealthy habits, the researchers found that those people most likely to change their habits for the better during the study were those people who got their spouse to make the same change or changes. 

In other words, ladies, if you’re really put off by the sight of old Beer-gut on the couch over there and you want him to start working on his weight before he develops diabetes or suffers a heart attack, there are only two good solutions to dealing with your unhappiness. 

The best way is to start exercising yourself. 

The alternative, I suppose, is to get a divorce so you don’t have to look at him (or her) any longer, but I recommend the former because if you choose that option, you will benefit, too.
