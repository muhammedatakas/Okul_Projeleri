Fatigue in young adults seems to be rampant. In fact, if you ask around among young folks, you’re likely to find that many, perhaps, most of them claim that they feel tired much of the time, in large part of course, because they stay up too late and get up too early (well, hey, if you don’t do that when you’re young, when are you going to do it?) 

Most young people would also likely add that they’d do just about anything not to feel so tired most of the time (within reason, of course). So the next time someone says that to you and you are either fed up with hearing their laments or you just feel like offering them some friendly middle-aged advice about what to do that doesn’t sound completely like a lecture (“grow up and just go to sleep early, dude”), then tell them about this recent study from the University of Georgia that concluded that healthy young adults who are “tired all the time” are easily treated with a light intensity workout. 

That’s right – working a bit harder and feeling a bit more tired in the short-term leaves you feeling a lot less fatigued in the longer term. In other words, the weakest excuse for avoiding exercise is the oldest one in the book, namely, “I’m too tired to exercise.” 

No, you’re not.
