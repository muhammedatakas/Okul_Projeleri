Lots of people suffering from chronic pain use magnets to relieve their pain, and many of them will swear by the relief they get from their magnets. But is that pain relief real? 
Or is it, as many sceptics argue, simply a placebo effect? 
Well, a recent study claims to have settled the controversy: placebo. 
But does it really settle matters? 
I don’t think so. 
What the study showed is that healthy volunteers who were exposed to magnets were not any better at discriminating the difference between 2 points on their skin than when they did a similar test without magnets. 
In other words, magnets did not affect the nerves that help in point discrimination. 
Since, point discrimination nerves are considered to be more “sensitive” than pain fibres, this means, the researchers write, that it’s very unlikely that magnets would affect pain fibres. 
Well, maybe. but maybe not, because pain is a lot more complex phenomenon than a simple signal along some nerves. 
For example, pressure on skin around a pain area (”rubbing a sore spot”), for example, often relieves pain, so it is possible that there are other aspects to magnet therapy that help relieve painful stimuli besides simple exposure to magnetic fields. 
In other words, if you are using a magnet and you think it’s helping, don’t throw it out based on this report.
