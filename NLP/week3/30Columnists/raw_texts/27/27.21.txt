It’s an unfair world: women might have way more to gain from exercise than men do.
A study presented at a recent meeting of the American Physiological Society, and which was done in exercising mice (those trying to fide the hidden cheese, I guess), has concluded that when male and female mice were both subjected to the same level of exercise, the female mice ended up much more “fit” than did the male mice.
It could be, of course, that the male mice didn’t get to the same fitness level as the females because the male mice secretly snuck out regularly to drink beer and carouse, but the researchers denied that possibility.
Rather, they said that it’s plain old physiology that determines that females develop bigger and stronger hearts than males from the same level of work.
The female mice also experienced improved levels of two proteins that have been linked with cardiac deterioration, whereas the male mice did not.
Now mice are not men, of course, and women are not either, but the researchers say that it’s likely that a similar situation exists in humans, that is, that women gain more from lesser exercise than men do, although in the end, the bottom line is the same for both genders: you still got to do some exercise at least to get fit.
