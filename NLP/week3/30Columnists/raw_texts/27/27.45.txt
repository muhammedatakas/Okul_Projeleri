I love peanut butter. No, I take that back. 
In fact, to paraphrase what Woody Allen told Diane Keaton once, “it’s more than love; I lurf peanut butter”. 
Actually, I lurf nuts in general from the pea to the Brazil to the cashew to the macadamia to whatever. 
I love nuts because they taste great, I love nuts because they’re a healthy treat, and I love nuts because as part of my world-famous trail mix (look it up in Dr. Art’s Guide to a Long and Healthy Life), a handful of nuts (although high in calories) is still a great snack, one guaranteed to keep you from eating what my mother calls “chazerai”, that is, garbage that’s bad for you and your weight, which is at least part of the reason why, although I eat several small helpings of nuts a day, my BMI is under still 23 (22.4, in fact, but hey, besides my wife, who’s keeping score?). 
So, I’m thrilled to report that a new study published in the American Journal of clinical Nutrition has backed me completely. 
In this study, people who ate the equivalent of one helping of peanut butter a day (2 level tablespoonfuls) were much more likely to get all the daily nutrients they required (vitamins such as folic acid and vitamin A, and minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and iron) than non eaters of peanut butter. 
Also, and I could’ve told you that, the peanut butter eaters had lower average BMIs. 
But here’s a hint: look for peanut butter that’s not got a lot of crap - meaning salt or sugar - added to it.
