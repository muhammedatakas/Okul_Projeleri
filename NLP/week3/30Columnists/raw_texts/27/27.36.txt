The most serious, over-looked vaccine in adults is without doubt vaccination against pneumonia, aka the pneumococcal vaccine, also aka Pneumovax.
There may be other vaccinations or boosters that are more commonly ignored by adults.
The tetanus booster, for example, or the newly-recommended whooping cough booster instantly spring to mind as other vaccines that are commonly neglected.
But forgetting or ignoring those vaccines just doesn’t lead to the same potentially serious consequences as does neglecting to get a pneumococcal vaccine.
So how important is pneumonia vaccine?
Very, it seems.
According to a recent study of 63,000 patients hospitalized for pneumonia (which is a major killer of at-risk adults, especially seniors with other serious health conditions), those who had not been vaccinated against pneumonia were 40 % to 70 % more likely to be diagnosed and hospitalized with this lung infection than were people who had been vaccinated.
Not only that, in this review, those who were unvaccinated were up to 70 % more likely to die from pneumonia while hospitalized than those who had been vaccinated.
The vaccinated were also less likely to develop kidney failure, heart attacks, and other serious health problems while in hospital.
And that’s quite a potential cost to pay for a simple vaccine, don’t you think?
So who should get the pneumococcal vaccine?
The simplest thing to remember is this: seniors and adults with certain serious chronic health conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and others.
If you’re in one of those groups – get that shot, sooner rather than later.
