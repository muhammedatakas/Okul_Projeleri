It’s been a horrendously bad period for medications recently. 

First came a pretty devastating report that anti-depressants may be no better than placebo for the vast majority of depressed patients.

In the same week, we learned from another report that Viagra (and presumably all the other drugs in its class) have a negative effect on sperm (at least in test tubes) meaning that these drugs may perhaps impair fertility in young men, who are using these drugs increasingly as party drugs (although if we keep hard-partying guys from multiplying, maybe that’s not such bad news).

The same week, too, a follow-up report on the famous Women’s Health Initiative (that’s the study that first pinpointed the many negative potential consequences of taking hormone replacement therapy for menopause) confirmed that yes, HRT does increase the risk of breast cancer (albeit less than the original WHI study had indicated might be the case), but just as worryingly for some women, HRT also significantly raises the risk that a woman will be told that she has an abnormal mammogram (when in fact there is nothing wrong with her breasts) and consequently, HRT also raises the risk of unnecessary breast biopsies in such women.

And although there were other “negative” drug studies that same week, the last report thatI want to flag that caught my eye was a report in the journal Nature Biotechnology that found that, in the lab at least, some statin drugs (specifically, lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin) damage mitochondria, which are the engines that drive the energy of cells, and hence the energy of life.

Interestingly, atorvastatin (Lipitor), by far the biggest-selling statin did now show the same effect.

What does this mean?

Well, it certainly could help explain why so many people who take statin drugs complain of muscle aches and pains, some so severely that they have to discontinue their use of the statin drugs.

It might also suggest that when someone complains of pain on a particular statin, if they really need to lower their LDL levels, then rather than just abandoning the use of statins altogether, that person should be tried on one of the statins that did not show this effect.
