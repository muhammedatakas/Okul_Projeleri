A 10-year-long pretty sober study (hey, it was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, and what could be more sobering than that?) concluded that organic tomatoes contain roughly double the anti-oxidant content of non-organic tomatoes, specifically 90 % more flavonoids (those are the anti-oxidants that are supposed to give green tea such a bang).
“Ergo”, you would say, “organic must be healthier”.
But as my profs used to say to me regularly (usually when they saw me skipping prematurely out of another class), “Not so fast, not so fast.”
In other words, it’s still very unclear if organic really is healthier for the vast majority of us.
First, this is one of only 2 or 3 studies to have concluded that organic produce contains more nutrients than non-organic; in other words, the jury is still out on this issue, and will be for a long time.
More important, even if organic tomatoes are loaded with more anti-oxidants than non-organic produce is, there is absolutely no evidence that any of us need such high intake from a particular source, nor that such a high intake would lower our risks of any chronic diseases.
What studies have shown is that an overall higher AVERAGE intake of fruits and veggies from a BALANCED diet is linked with a lower rate of certain illnesses.
In other words, as one commentator noted, you can get a ton of lycopene from eating ketchup, but no one (besides a hot dog-loving kid, that is) would argue that having ketchup with every meal is a good thing to do.
There are lots of reasons to buy organic - I do because I prefer the taste and because I think it encourages better agricultural practices - but you shouldn’t be talked into buying organic because it’s “healthier.”
