The latest hyped study on the potential link between cell phone usage and the development of brain cancer will settle exactly nothing.

In this study published in the British Journal of Cancer, Japanese researchers compared 322 brain cancer patients with 683 healthy people and concluded that using cell phones did not increase the risk of brain cancer.

The problem with this conclusion, however, is that this study is just too limited in scope to really settle this vexing issue: can cell phones either cause or accelerate the progress of some kinds of cancer in some people.

First, this study is tiny.

Second, a study such as this cannot tease out special groups that might be particularly sensitive to the radiation emitted by cell phones (kids, for example, immediately spring to mind, or people who may have had been exposed to other significant sources of extra radiation such as several CT scans), nor is there any way to determine from a study such as this if there is any long-term risks from mobile phone use.

The common sense bottom line is simple: cell phones probably don’t raise the risk of brain cancer, but since the long-term risk remains unknown, the best thing is to limit their use for only necessary purposes, especially in potentially extra-sensitive groups, such as young kids.

And oh yes, always limit your cell phone use when you’re around me: there’s nothing I dislike more these days than someone beside me yakking loudly and brainlessly into a cell phone.
