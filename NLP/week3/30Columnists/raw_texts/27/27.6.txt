What if the drugs you were taking for a very serious condition, cancer, for example, were developed in studies based on faulty science?

Pretty scary prospect, right?

Well, unfortunately, and not to alarm anyone, that’s exactly what some say has happened for some of the anti-breast cancer drugs out there.

According to an article in the highly-reputable journal, Science, some of the breast cancer drugs that have come along over the last few years were developed from studies that used a set of cancer cells that were not really breast cancer cells.

Rather, they were cells taken from a melanoma, a skin cancer, and no one, it seems, noticed this error until recently.

Now, it’s very important to point out that this assertion – that the line of cells used in over 600 studies meant to be done on breast cancer cells but were actually done on skin cancer cells – is still highly contentious, and many of the scientists working on those cells still believe them to be breast cancer cells, although an emerging number of researchers now seem to be accepting that there may be a better line of cells to be used than the ones that are at issue here.

And before anyone taking anti-cancer drugs panics that this means their drugs may not work, it’s important to also point out that the results of the studies that used this cell line are probably still valid.

It would certainly make everyone less anxious, though, if breast cancer researchers started using a cell line that was clearly a breast cancer cell line and not one that may have come from some other kind of tumour.

Just suggesting.
