Two new studies in the online edition of The New England Journal of Medicine have identified three common genetic variations that are linked to restless leg syndrome (RLS), that curious condition in which (as the name implies) people complain of a constant need to move their legs, especially at night, which clearly has a terrible effect on sleep.
But why, those of you who’ve never had RLS might be tempted to ask, does it matter that we’ve found a couple of genes that raise the risk of RLS by up to 50 %?
Because, quite simply, it makes RLS real.
You see, RLS is like so many other conditions (fibromylagia, food sensitivities, excess fatigue, headache, chronic fatigue, chronic pain and many more) in that there is really no good definitive pathological change in RLS that helps diagnose the condition.
That means that doctors (and spouses and family members) pretty much have to depend on the person’s story to accept the diagnosis, which means in turn that lots of people don’t believe a person who complains of RLS (or one of those other aforementioned conditions).
So, as someone who’s long believed that RLS is very real, it’s quite affirming for me to see these twin studies come to the conclusion that a gene is responsible for many cases, although as matters stand now, there’s still a long way to go before we have a good test for RLS.
Nonetheless, this finding will give a lot of comfort to those people who’ve had this problem for years and who’ve not been believed.
