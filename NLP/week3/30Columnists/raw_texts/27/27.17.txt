This study (see 2 previous items) raises several important issues, and here’s yet another one: who “owns” the data from a study.

What I mean is this: Does the party paying for the study (the funder) own the data, allowing him/her to do exactly as they wish with the results, that is, publish the data or not depending on the utility of the information for the funder’s benefits?

Or when a study is launched, does that also immediately initiate a moral contract with the persons being studied that no matter what the results may be, those results will be distributed to the patients (and hence to the public) so that they can then decide what to do with the consequences of that new information?

In other words, when a person is enrolled in a study that compares a drug to a placebo, they do so presumably because they are told that we simply don’t know which is better, the placebo or the drug we’re testing, so hey, how about volunteering to find out, and when we know, we’ll be able to tell you what to do.

This would be especially true for a condition such as depression, of course, so that in depression studies, depressed patients are encouraged to enrol with reassurances such as, “if you put yourself on the line and help us test this new drug (or the placebo, because in fact, you won’t know which one you get till the study is over), there will be an eventual terrific pay-off for you in that when the study is over, you will know which road to take: medication or not”.

If, however, the results from such studies are massaged in any way, or, worse buried or ignored when the medication doesn’t turn out to be as effective or as safe as the manufacturer had hoped, and further, if the positive results that come from other studies are manipulated to make those positive results seem to carry a stronger endorsement than the data really indicates it should, is that not akin to breaking that moral contract with the patient.

Why should patients volunteer for studies (aside from the money, of course) if the results are not complete and as free of bias as they can be?
