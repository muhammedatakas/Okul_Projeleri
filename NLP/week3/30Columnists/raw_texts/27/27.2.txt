I’ve always had a “weight problem”, by which I mean that I gain weight very, very easily and the only way I can keep my weight down is by exercising a lot (which admittedly, is not hard for me to do since all I have to do is try to keep up with my wife, a notorious exercise maniac), as well as by being very careful about what and especially about how much I eat.

But one of the key things I’ve learned from that lifelong battle with weight control is how hard it is for most of us to keep our weights under that magic formula of a BMI of 25 or less, and because I also have a terrific respect for Mother Nature, who is clearly one smart gal, and who clearly, I think, wants us to stick around a long time, I’ve long argued that excess weight doesn’t matter nearly as much as a risk factor for your health as does your overall activity level.

In other words, if you want to reduce your risk of dying prematurely or getting sick early in life, you should not, I think, focus on your weight as a risk factor nearly as much as you should focus on how much exercise you do.

All of which brings us to a study just published in the Archives of Internal Medicine that followed the health of over 5000 American adults as part of the (US) National Health and Nutritional Surveys between the years 1999 and 2004, and as you’d expect, more than half these typical Americans were overweight.

But here’s the interesting thing: 51 % of those who were overweight and about a third of those who were obese were nonetheless also “metabolically healthy”, that is, their cholesterol levels, their blood sugar levels, their blood pressure readings and other markers of metabolic health were within normal limits.

In other words, these people were fat, yes, and some were very fat (obese) but they were still healthy, and the word “still” is crucial here because we really have no idea how long they maintain these healthy metabolic readings, although as my mom always says, “So far, so good”.

But here’s the other sobering observation from this study: about ¼ (23 %) of those who were at so-called “normal weight” (their BMI was under 25, in other words) had metabolic readings that put them at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke or developing Type 2 diabetes.

Bottom line: weight does matter in terms of your cardiovascular risk profile, but not nearly as much, I suggest, as at least two other risk factors, namely smoking and exercise.
