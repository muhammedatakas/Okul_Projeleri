The long-standing mantra is that if a man lives long enough, he will definitely develop symptoms attributable to an enlarged prostate, or as my wife used to put it, “the prostate gets all men in the end.”
These symptoms include nearly anything to do with difficulty urinating: dribbling, frequency, needing to urinate more often at night, trouble starting and stopping, and so on.
And the discouraging thing is that no study has ever shown that there’s a whole lot a man can do about slowing down his prostate’s relentless march to grow, grow, growing, although studies have shown that certain medications can improve the uncomfortable symptoms of an enlarged prostate.
So the good news is that a study just published in the American Journal of Epidemiology claims to have found several lifestyle factors linked to an enlarged prostate.
Specifically, a high-fat diet raised the risk of symptoms of prostate enlargement by 31 %, daily consumption of red meat was linked to a 38 % increased risk, while eating lots of fruits and veggies lowered the risk by 1/3, and a moderate intake of alcohol on a regular basis also lowered the risk by 38 %.
The bottom line is simple, and something that women have known for eons: what’s good for a man’s heart is also good for parts more distant parts.
