Many studies have shown that the more education a person gets throughout their lifetime, the slower the inevitable deterioration in their brain function as they age, and there’s a particularly strong link between higher education levels and the slower onset of dementia.
So what is it about more education that protects the brain?
The most likely explanation is that the more you use your brain in school (and no matter what you think about the entire education edifice these days, you still have to use your brain a bit in the school system, if only to come up with new excuses, resentments, and demands), the more spare brain capacity you build up, a reserve of function that you can then call into play when your brain is being hit with all those problems that afflict old brains, such as Alzheimer’s disease, which is a condition in which amyolid “plaques” are laid down in the brain.
All this certainly makes sense to my slowing brain, and I’m happy to say that a recent study offered excellent evidence that there is really something to this theory.
In this study published in the Archives of Neurology, researchers used PET scans to find amyloid plaques and hence determine the presence of AD in people, and to no one’s surprise, the ones with the least amount of plaque build-up had the highest cognitive scores.
But most interestingly, people with a fair amount of plaque build-up who had also done some post-graduate work in university still scored fairly high in their cognitive testing, that is, people who had done post-grad work and who had evidence of the presence of Alzheimer’s disease still managed to maintain a lot of brain function.
Your brain is exactly like every other part of you, I’m afraid: if you abuse it or don’t use it, you lose it.
