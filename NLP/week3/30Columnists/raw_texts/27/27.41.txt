I hate to do this because hormone replacement therapy for menopause (HRT) has received so much bad press this last year, but there’s yet another negative report about HRT to tell you about. According to a study in the Lancet that followed over 120,000 women for 1 year after having a screening mammogram, in women who were thin, or in those who had breast cancer surgery, or in those who had taken HRT, screening mammograms were not as accurate as in other women. 
Specifically, screening mammograms missed more cancers in this group of women, with the worse record being those women who had been on HRT. 
In fact, in women who had been on HRT, screening mammography picked up only 83 % of cancers, which, if you ask me, is a pretty poor rate for a screening test. 

That said, I don’t want any woman to take this study as an excuse not to get regular screening mammograms because like Todd Bertuzzi and our Olympic atheletes, they may not be perfect, but they’re the best we’ve got.
