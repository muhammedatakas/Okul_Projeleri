Alcohol may sting when poured on cuts and scrapes, but its cooling effects on intact skin have led many parents to employ it as a quick home remedy against fevers in small children. 

According to a recent study in the journal Pediatrics, the folk treatment seems especially common among parents in low-income and minority communities, where it is passed down through generations and in some cases recommended by doctors. As rubbing, or isopropyl, alcohol evaporates from skin, it soothes like a fresh breeze, potentially reducing body temperature. Many parents soothe their feverish children by rubbing it on the skin or adding a little to a sponge bath.

But using it this way can cause serious harm. Isopropyl alcohol is quickly absorbed through the skin, and large amounts applied topically can be inhaled, which can lead to alcohol poisoning and other problems. A number of case reports in the medical literature describe small children who slipped into comas after a caregiver tried to reduce their fevers with alcohol. Other reports have described cases in which adults suffered cardiac and neurological problems after using alcohol-soaked towels to cool down or ease pain. 

For better results, try plain and simple acetaminophen, at least after the child’s first birthday , and a lukewarm bath — minus the rubbing alcohol.
