With spring just around the corner, millions of hay fever sufferers are gearing up for another season of sneezing, sniffling and congestion. 


But many hay fever sufferers are unaware that a pollen allergy can result in an allergy to fruits and vegetables, known as oral allergy syndrome. 

Scientists say this occurs when the immune system mistakes the proteins in some fruits and vegetables for molecules of pollen that have a similar structure. When the fruit or vegetable protein is consumed, antibodies attack it, setting off mild symptoms that can last for several minutes and include swelling and itching in the mouth, ears and lips. As many as 70 percent of those with hay fever are affected. 

Research shows that certain allergies usually correspond to specific fruits. People with an allergy to ragweed typically have allergies to gourds, like squash, zucchini, cucumbers and any kind of melon. An allergy to birch pollen usually corresponds to allergies to apples, apricots, pears, peaches and cherries. An allergy to mugwort can mean problems with carrots, celery and some spices; an allergy to grass pollen may lead to trouble with tomatoes, potatoes and oranges. 

But simple steps can solve the problem. Cooking and microwaving are usually enough to denature the proteins. And peeling can do the trick, since the proteins are often found in skin.
