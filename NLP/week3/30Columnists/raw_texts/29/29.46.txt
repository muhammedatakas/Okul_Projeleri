An 8-year-old Long Island boy died this week of what was believed to be a fast-moving form of bacterial meningitis, health officials said on Friday.


If autopsy results confirm the suspected cause of death, the boy would be at least the third person in New York to have died of bacterial meningitis in two weeks. The disease, an infection that attacks and inflames the outer membranes of the brain and spinal cord, typically kills only a few hundred people nationwide each year.

The latest victim was a third grader who lived in Medford. Suffolk County health officials said on Friday that the boy began complaining of serious symptoms on Wednesday night, saying he had pain in his neck and arm. He was taken to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital the next morning, and died later that afternoon.

The boy, whose name was not released, was a student at Brookhaven Elementary School. Health officials said that after he died, they notified all parents in his school district, South Country, of the case, and that everyone who had been in close contact with him was being treated with antibiotics. So far, they said, none of those people have shown any symptoms.

The earlier cases killed a student, 17, and a guidance counselor, 27. The student, Michael Gruber, a senior at Massapequa High School on Long Island, died Jan. 24 after experiencing flulike symptoms that morning and the night before. On Jan. 25, LeeAnne Burke, a guidance counselor at St. Francis Preparatory High School in Queens, died after experiencing what she thought was a cold.

Health officials said days later that they believed the cases were probably not connected.

The most common form of the disease is usually transmitted through respiratory droplets, and symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, confusion and sleepiness. It is rarely fatal.
