Most people with asthma know that smoke, mold and chemicals in the air can set off asthma attacks. But thunderstorms? It is a relationship scientists looked at for years, and a counterintuitive one since thunderstorms are generally thought to clear the air. Yet almost every study to examine the link has found a strong one. 


The most recent study , published in the journal Thorax, is perhaps the most exhaustive. It was conducted by a team of climatologists and epidemiologists who looked at more than 10 million emergency room visits in 41 hospitals during an 11-year period in Atlanta. Of 215,832 asthma emergency room visits, the team found that 28,350 occurred on days that followed thunderstorms, an incidence at least 3 percent higher than on days that did not. That figure may not sound like much, but in a city of millions of people, it could translate into thousands of cases -- and possibly many deaths. 

Several other studies over the years have also found spikes in the number of cases after stormy weather. The reason is something of a mystery, but scientists believe thunderstorms can spread pollutants, release asthma-inducing starch particles and rupture pollen grains, making them small enough to enter the airways.
