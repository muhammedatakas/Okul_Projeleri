Headaches can be an excruciating side effect of routine procedures that involve puncturing the middle and lower back, including spinal taps and anesthetic injections like epidurals.

Doctors and medical texts have long advocated a simple antidote: a cup of Joe. One theory is that the caffeine narrows the cerebral blood vessels, which helps reverse the vasodilation that occurs when a puncture causes cerebrospinal fluid to leak. Research, however, suggests it does not help. 

In 2007, researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona reviewed several randomized studies that looked at caffeine as a treatment for the condition, known as postdural puncture headache, and found no evidence it worked. That echoed the findings of a separate study at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, which found slim evidence supporting caffeine or another popular antidote, more fluid intake. 

Other studies suggest that the most effective treatment is one called epidural blood patching. It can be invasive, but it relieves headaches in 85 to 98 percent of patients. It also helps when smaller needles are used.
