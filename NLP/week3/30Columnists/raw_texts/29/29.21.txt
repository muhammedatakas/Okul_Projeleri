By now, the old saw about drinking eight glasses of water a day has been thoroughly debunked. But a similar adage about excess water and healthy skin persists. Where or how the claim originated is not well known, but there is no evidence that drinking anything more than recommended amounts of water is particularly beneficial to skin. 


A 2007 study on the effects of water consumption did show that drinking 500 milliliters of water, about two cups, increased blood flow to the skin. A good sign, but there was no evidence that that reduced wrinkles or improved complexion. Other studies have hinted that vitamin C might prevent wrinkles, or that estrogen use in postmenopausal women might reduce dry skin and slow skin aging. But the evidence for each is limited, and estrogen therapy can have bad side effects. 

Dr. Margaret E. Parsons, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology, said excess water did not help the skin but ''if dehydrated, fine wrinkles certainly seem to show up a bit more.'' 

''Staying appropriately hydrated is good for our general health,'' she said, ''and if we are eating and drinking what we should, our bodies are healthier and therefore our skin as well.'' 

Her advice? Always wear sunscreen, avoid cigarettes and eat well.
