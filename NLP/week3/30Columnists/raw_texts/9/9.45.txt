Doctors are failing to spot Asperger's syndrome in girls, a leading expert on autism has warned.
Judith Gould says the stereotype of it being a boy's condition means thousands of girls are going undiagnosed and turning to self-harm and eating disorders in their struggle to cope.
It is generally accepted that one in 100 children has autism or a related condition, such as Asperger's - and that boys outnumber girls by a figure of between four and 16 to 1.
But Dr Gould, of the National Autistic Society's Lorna Wing Centre for Autism, believes the ratio to stand at just 2.5 boys for every girl.
She says girls slip through the net because they are better at disguising the symptoms of the condition, which is sometimes described as a high-functioning form of autism.
A boy with Asperger's might have an intense fascination with trains but not have any friends, while a girl might retreat into a fantasy world and have one friend.
Speaking ahead of the drawing up of a new national strategy on autism, Dr Wing said: 'Girls are not being picked up because there is still a stereotyped view of what Asperger's is, which is based entirely on how boys present with the condition.
'We are failing girls at the moment.  We are doing many thousands of them a great disservice.'
Actress Jane Asher, the National Autistic Society's president, told the Observer: 'Women tell us that these misconceptions can make their particular struggles and battles more difficult.
'They say that getting a diagnosis in the first place can often feel like an insurmountable huddle, with many doctors unaware that the condition can affect females.'
