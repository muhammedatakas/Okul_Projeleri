Young doctors are putting patients' lives at risk because they are not being trained to prescribe medicines, a leading doctor has warned.
David Webb, a pharmacologist and the former head of the Scottish drugs' rationing body, said doctors are leaving medical school with little or no knowledge about how to prescribe drugs.
Some nurses know more about the skill, which is becoming ever more complex due to advances in drug development and the needs of the ageing population.
 
The Edinburgh University professor said: 'When I qualified, there were two drugs used for the treatment of heart attack patients, now there are up to 22 drugs.
'Prescribing has got a lot more complex over the last 15 years.
'You might think medical schools would spend a lot more time teaching about prescribing but the exact opposite is the case.'
He said a shake-up of medical training in the early 1990s left little pharmacology being taught, and as a result 'the vast majority' of young doctors do not feel ready to dish out drugs when they start on the wards.
His opinion is confirmed by research by the body that oversees doctors' training, the General Medical Council.
Its study of junior doctors trained at three different medical schools found some struggled with the simple arithmetic needed to calculate drug doses.
Just one in six of the Warwick University-trained medics passed an eight-question test on prescribing.
The report concluded: 'There was a consistent thread of under-preparedness for prescribing.
'Prescribing was also the main area of practice in which errors were reported by respondents, indicating a significant  potential risk.
'Risks were reduced, but not removed, by support from colleagues, with F1s (newly-qualified doctors) speaking particularly highly about the help received from pharmacists.'
