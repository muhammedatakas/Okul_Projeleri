A jab to beat prostate, bowel and kidney cancers is being developed by scientists. 
Tests on hundreds of patients show the TroVax vaccine can boost a patient's chances of survival with few side-effects. 
In some bowel cancer cases, it extended patients' lives by more than a year, a cancer conference heard.
 

If larger-scale trials are as successful, the jab could be on the market in as little as five years. 
Prostate, bowel and kidney cancers affect 80,000 Britons a year and kill 30,000. 
Although the jab will initially be used to treat the disease, in time, it could also be used as a preventative measure. 

The brainchild of scientists at British-based Oxford BioMedica, TroVax uses the body's own immune system to destroy tumours. 
A virus shell packed with genes containing the blueprint for a protein called 5T4 is injected into the arm. 
Once inside the body, the genes start making the 'foreign' protein, setting alarm bells ringing in the immune system. It then makes antibodies that attack the tumour. 

Analysis of data from nine trials shows that 88 per cent of patients who were vaccinated produced antibodies. 
And the more they made, the greater their chances of survival. 
A good antibody response improved the average survival time of bowel cancer patients by around 15 months, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer conference in Geneva heard. 
Dr Richard Harrop of Oxford BioMedica, said that while more trials were needed, he was ' cautiously optimistic' about the results. 
He said: 'Our exploratory analysis of data from nine different trials of TroVax demonstrate significant associations between immune responses and overall survival in patients with colorectal (bowel) cancer, renal (kidney) cancer and prostate cancer. In addition, the data show the vaccine is well tolerated by patients.' 
Large-scale trials on kidney and bowel cancer are already under way and, if all goes well, the jab could be on the market by 2013.
