Fashion group Alexon joined the list of retail casualties today as it warned it will miss City profit forecasts, sending its shares plunging.

The group, which owns Bay Trading and brands such as Ann Harvey, said sales have slumped in recent weeks. Already down by 5% like-for-like in September, the decline has stretched to 7% in the 18 weeks to December 1.

Whilst the outcome for the full year is still dependent on the Christmas trading, chief executive John Osborn said it is already unlikely that profits will meet City forecasts. These had been around the £15m level for the year to end January, but the group now expects them to be in the range of £11.5m to £12.5m.

Next year looks set to be "equally challenging," the group said, although margins are improving and Osborn said he is confident that measures taken to strengthen Alexon's portfolio of brands "will stand us in good stead for the future".

However, analysts at Panmure Gordon said today's figures imply a halving of profits in the second half and that any expectation of a bounce back next year looks optimistic, despite the management's confidence.

Ramona Tipnis at Numis also warned that, given that trading conditions appear to be deteriorating into December, the final outcome for the year ended next month could be even worse.

Alexon shares closed down 10% at 96.25p.
