Royal Bank of Scotland is on course to make record profits of £10bn even though the Edinburgh-based bank is taking a £1.5bn hit from the sub-prime mortgage crisis.

In a much-anticipated trading statement, the UK's second biggest bank calmed the market's fears about its trading positions and helped drive its shares by nearly 3% by the close, to 478p.

The bank is making writedowns in a number of areas - some £950m related to the US sub-prime market, £250m on its leverage finance portfolio and £300m on mortgage-related assets within ABN Amro, the Dutch bank it bought part of in October. 

The writedowns might have been larger had RBS not been able to reduce the value of its own debt by £250m and means that if ABN is excluded, the hit to the bank's profits is restrained to £950m, less than the market's worse fears of as much as £2bn. 

The bank said its profits would be "well ahead" of City expectations for profits in 2007 of £9.8bn.

Chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin highlighted the "diversity and quality" of RBS's business and said that while some of its operations have been hit by the market conditions, underlying earnings growth has remained "comparatively unaffected".

The integration of ABN Amro, the Dutch bank it bought in October after a fierce bidding war with rival Barclays, is "off to a promising start," said Goodwin.

He expects better returns from the £49bn acquisition than had been envisaged at the time of the deal, which was the world's biggest-ever banking takeover.

"More importantly, the increased exposure to many high growth economies that ABN Amro brings us seems more attractive and relevant than ever," he added.

The writedowns might have been larger had RBS not been able to reduce the value of its own debt by £250m.
