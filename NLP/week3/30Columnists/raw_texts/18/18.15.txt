Lloyds TSB provided some much-needed cheer for the beleaguered banking sector today as it reported higher profits and said it had withstood the worst of the credit crunch.

Underlying profits for 2007 were up by 6%, to £3.92bn, and shareholders see their dividend total raised by 5% to 35.9p a share.

The group, Britain's fifth-biggest bank, has taken a £280m hit on risky sub-prime loans, but that is only a fraction of the figure suffered by rivals such as Barclays, which earlier this week revealed a £1.6bn write-down.

Chairman Sir Victor Blank said the bank had benefited from its cautious approach.

"Our lower risk strategy limited the impact of the abrupt change in the markets and, consequently, our charge was relatively modest in comparison to our balance sheet size, our earnings, and the charges taken by many other organisations

"This is in large part due to the conscious choice to focus the group's strategy on building deep, long-lasting relationships with our customers in order to deliver high quality, sustainable results over time."

On the retail banking side, the group said it is now the number one provider of current accounts, cards and personal loans and opened more than 1m new current accounts last year.

Its shares jumped more than 5% to 460.75p as analysts applauded the results. Describing the group as "a safe pair of hands" Alex Potter at Collins Stewart pointed out that while the write-down had risen from £201m to £280m, the figure is still "tiny by sector standards". 

He highlighted the £185m hit taken by Alliance & Leicester, whose balance sheet is five times smaller than Lloyds TSB's.

"What was once simply a low-growth bank is now showing the benefits of conservatism in its business model and balance sheet," Potter said.
