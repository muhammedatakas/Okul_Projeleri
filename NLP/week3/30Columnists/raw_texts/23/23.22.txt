There’s no question that the fitness industry has diversified. Anyone looking to mix up their workout routine can choose from a cornucopia of unique fitness programs. One of the biggest reasons for this fitness programming explosion is the influx of Eastern-influenced exercise techniques and philosophies. Mind/Body classes, as they’re often categorized, are thriving in gyms and community centers all over the country, even in the smallest of towns. 

In addition to the usual benefits of exercise like improved endurance, strength, and flexibility, the benefits of Mind/Body classes include:
•    stress reduction
•    improved posture 
•    improved circulation
•    heightened sensory awareness
•    improved concentration and cognitive function 
•    improved sense of well-being

These benefits are what inspired me to step my (bare)foot into a Nia class. Created in the early 1980s by two fitness instructors weary of the high-impact aerobics movement, Nia is an acronym for Neuromuscular Integrative Action. To the untrained, or unenlightened eye, Nia may look like tai chi on acid. But it’s actually a choreographed combination of tai chi, tae kwan do, aikido, jazz dance, modern dance, and yoga. The program takes a holistic approach to fitness—keeping the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.

From the moment I entered the studio years ago, I knew Nia would be a class like no other I had taken before. The participants were a group of college girls, moms, and senior citizens, with a few dad-types in the mix, too. Our fearless leader, a certified Nia instructor, managed to lead this diverse group in a series routines that at times had us dancing the merengue and performing various karate kicks. Nia instructors are trained to present movements at three intensity levels—high, medium, and low—so everyone in our class felt accommodated. There was a sense of unity. I’ve been doing Nia ever since.

The music used in a Nia class is similarly diverse. African rhythms may be followed by atmospheric sounds from nature or a popular love song. But music isn’t the only sound you’ll hear in a Nia class. Vocalization is also part of the experience. Instructors may prompt students to shout “yes!” while reaching for the sky or grunt “huh!” while performing a tae kwon do kick. 

Self-expression is highly encouraged in Nia, which means it’s time to leave your inhibitions at the door. The instructor will often teach students a basic step then cue them to explore its possibilities. At this time the students and the instructor move independently all over the room, feeling free to add their own style to the basic step. Students who are normally quiet and shy outside the classroom may be the most uninhibited inside the classroom. A good Nia instructor will create an environment where students can feel safe to express themselves by encouraging a sense of both playfulness and empowerment.

The fitness component of a Nia class is delivered in a similar way as a dance class- it’s a total body workout. You’re challenging your cardiovascular system as well as your major muscle groups. The difference is that in a Nia class, there is no wrong way to perform the choreography. Unless a student is doing something unsafe, the instructor will not critique the movement. 

So why isn’t Nia more popular? The truth is that not everyone is cut out for the free-form expression that’s encouraged in a Nia class. Some people feel too self-conscious or uncomfortable to move freely without the structure of a traditional fitness class. Still, there are Nia classes popping up all over the country. The NiaNow.com website is a good resource for finding a local class.

One final note: One of the joys of working with and raising kids is watching them play and dance with abandon. We long to be able to move like that as we drudge through our workday. There are very few Nia classes for kids—but I suspect we need them more than they do.
