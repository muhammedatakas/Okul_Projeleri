Having an active sex life in their 50s could protect men against prostate cancer, say researchers. 

But greater levels of sexual activity among men in their 20s could increase their chances of developing the disease in later life, they warn. 

Men who are ‘very’ sexually active in their 20s and 30s are more at risk, a study shows. Researchers at Nottingham University conclude that keeping up a regular sex life – rather than excessive activity in younger years followed by a fallow period – is best for men’s health. 

Dr Polyxeni Dimitropoulou, now at the University of Cambridge, said: ‘We were keen to look at the links between sexual activity and younger men as a lot of prostate cancer studies focus on older men as the disease is more prevalent in men over 50.

‘Hormones appear to play a key role in prostate cancer and it is very common to treat men with therapy to reduce the hormones thought to stimulate the cancer cells. 

‘A man’s sex drive is also regulated by his hormone levels, so this study examined the theory that having a high sex drive affects the risk of prostate cancer.’ 

Engaging in sexual activity more than 20 times a month between the 20s and 30s increased the risk of prostate cancer, says a report in this month’s issue of the British Journal of Urology International. But frequent activity in a man’s 40s and later appeared to have little impact on their risk. 

Men in their 50s who were most sexually active, engaging in sexual activity more than ten times a month, had a ‘small’ level of protection against the disease. 

Dr Dimitripolou said: ‘One theory is that during the early years the prostate gland is more susceptible to hormonal changes and is still developing. 

‘As men age and accumulate toxins from the diet or through their lungs, sexual activity may help release them.’
