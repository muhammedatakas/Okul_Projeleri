MARGO MacDONALD wants satellite and cable sports channels to cut their subscription costs to help pubs which are struggling because of the smoking ban.

The Independent Lothians MSP said small public houses and bars had seen significant reductions in their takings since the ban was introduced in March 2006.

And now they face a hike in charges for screening football matches.

Ms MacDonald called on the Scottish Government to make representations to Setanta Sport Holdings and British Sky Broadcasting to reduce the cost of commercial satellite and cable sports subscriptions.

She said: "I've had several publicans approach me about this and they are from the smaller pubs who take the kind of approach we should encourage if we want to see sensible drinking.

"Already the smoking ban has affected their trade and if they are going to be hit with a double whammy from increased costs for showing football on pub screens, I fear a lot of them will go out of business."

But Public Health Minister Shona Robison said there was no robust evidence to show the smoking ban has had an adverse effect on sales in Scottish pubs.
