NATURAL justice demands that Danny Guthrie is punished with much more than a three-game ban by the FA for his angry assault on Craig Fagan.

Because Hull’s Fagan has been guilty of some bad challenges himself, there are internet messages saying he “got what he had coming to him”. But that is not the way the law operates and should not be the way football operates. 

Fagan is entitled to the same protection as other players.

And, since what Newcastle’s Guthrie did was far worse than a routine football offence, he deserves more than the routine punishment. 

The FA overstepped their powers when they gave Ben Thatcher an additional suspension for elbowing Pedro Mendes in the head in 2006. Thatcher, then at Manchester City, was handed an eight-match ban with 15 games suspended for two years after a challenge which left Portsmouth’s Mendes needing a brain scan.

Privately, the FA acknowledged they had gone against their own rules by dealing with Thatcher like that and are wary of upsetting FIFA by going outside the rules again. Yet unless the FA deal rigorously with acts of violence they run the risk of the police or victims taking action against the perpetrators. Fagan is considering a claim for damages but might also think about a private prosecution for grievous bodily harm.

The authorities do not want lots of court cases. They want to keep control of their own disciplinary procedures and are reviewing the rules and considering introducing a sliding scale of punishments. 

But in the mean time they need to deal with Guthrie. They must change their mind about letting him off with three games, bend the rules as in Thatcher’s case, and hit him hard. That’s what he did to Fagan.
