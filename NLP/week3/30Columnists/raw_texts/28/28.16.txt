IF YOU doubt the value of this week’s Carling Cup games, think about the FA Cup match that almost brought the house down.

When Gillingham scored against Aston Villa, the celebrating players caused a low wall to tip over, spilling six breeze blocks on to the floor.



There was silence at the other end of the ground where Villa fans were, in what I know to be the scariest stand in the Football League. It is a temporary, uncovered affair which makes you feel like you are ­sitting on builders’ scaffolding.

Priestfield is not the most salubrious stadium, but the 10,107 attendance for this tie was more than double Gillingham’s normal gate and will help their hand-to-mouth existence.

Similarly, the Carling Cup is the single most important ­mechanism the Football League have for partially addressing the iniquitously uneven distribution of wealth within the game.

Rights for the Carling Cup are a big part of what the League put on the table when negotiating with broadcasters and, from next season, the League’s total TV deal will bring in £88million a year.

That is small change compared to what Premier League clubs divvy up between them – but it will buy a few breeze blocks.
