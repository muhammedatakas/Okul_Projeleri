REFEREE Rob Styles was isolated last night after standing by his contentious decision to send off Newcastle’s Habib Beye.


Styles watched replays of the incident and concluded he was right to award a penalty for a foul by Beye and so correct about the dismissal. He refused to rescind the red card. 



But then Newcastle launched an official appeal and there were indications it will succeed. 



Former referee Dermott Gallagher, who is paid by the Premier League to give expert opinions to Sky Sports News, told them: “I don’t think it was a penalty and nor do other people in the Premier League.” 



The appeal will be heard tomorrow and if it is successful the defender can play on Saturday at Sunderland. If it fails, he misses that game. 



Yesterday’s developments followed Newcastle’s 2-2 draw with Manchester City on Monday when Beye tackled Robinho from behind. 



Styles signalled a penalty and, because the clash had denied Robinho a clear goalscoring chance, sent off Beye. But Newcastle boss Joe Kinnear asked Styles to review the decision and rescind the card. 
 




Those on Beye’s side say he got his toe to the ball. But Law 12 says that it is a foul tackle if you make contact with the man before touching the ball. Even when a player touches the ball first, it can still be a foul if the follow-through fells an opponent who might otherwise have reached the ball. 



Styles is the fourth official on Sunday for Chelsea-Liverpool, but the fact he is not refereeing is not a punishment.
