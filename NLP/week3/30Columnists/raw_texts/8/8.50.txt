According to eye- witnesses, the song that provoked Jose Mourinho, the Inter Milan manager, allegedly to strike a fan after Wednesday's defeat at Manchester United was: 'Go home, Mourinho.' 

It was chanted repeatedly by a large group while he was trying to conduct a television interview. (The fan was from Cambridge, so no Mancunians were hurt in the making of this story.) Isn't that wonderful, though? 'Go home, Mourinho.' 

A good job these cherubs were not employing a phrase that is a little, shall we say, stronger. A compound verb beginning with the letter F, perhaps. No, perish the thought. Fans never sing songs like that. They always tell unpopular personalities simply to go home. 

Like that other song they sing: 'The referee's a rascal.' 'We thought he was going to sign autographs,' said witness Steven Mace, unemployed, from Doncaster, when Mourinho marched over to the crowd with a face like thunder. What an astute observer of human behaviour. After all, who wouldn't be filled with love for his fellow man at that moment? 

You're the manager of Inter Milan, your team has just been knocked out of the tournament you were employed to win, you have done 15 rounds with the Italian press who all want you sacked and then you have conducted a live television interview with a mob in the background telling you to f*** off (sorry, to go home). 

Who wouldn't then be bounding over with a cry of: 'Good evening to you all gentlemen, now form an orderly line, who should I make the first one out to?' And I abhor violence, too. So I am not saying that, whatever the circumstances, Mourinho should have slapped anybody. I'm just saying I'd understand if he has.
