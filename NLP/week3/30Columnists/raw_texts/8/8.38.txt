Rafael Benitez, the Liverpool manager, will no doubt find at least one powerful, vocal ally in his view that senior club officials such as David Gill, the chief executive of Manchester United, should not become too empowered within the Football Association. 

Sir Alex Ferguson should definitely be behind him, for this was precisely his opinion when David Dein, former vice-chairman of Arsenal, was a prominent figure at the FA. 

Indeed, so firm is Ferguson in his quest for complete impartiality that he is even opposed to supporters of football clubs, let alone employees, assuming a position of influence. Only recently, he was in a lather about Nicholas Stewart QC, who headed the independent panel that banned Patrice Evra for four matches, being a season-ticket holder at Arsenal. 

Now some would argue this is an extreme view. After all, was Stewart meant to forgo the pleasure of being a football supporter throughout his young life on the off-chance that he would become a respected figure in specialist sports arbitration? Imagine him as an eager teenager...

'Coming to the match, Nicholas?' 

'No, for one day many decades from now, I may be asked to sit in judgment on football matters and this would compromise my integrity. I shall watch it on Match of the Day, where I can observe all teams equally, without thought of favour.' 

'Eh? Oh, all right then, please yourself. Weirdo.' 

Isn't it ironic? The professional game wants people who understand football to sit in judgment, but then cries foul if a person has even the most obscure link with another club. 

How is that meant to work, then? How many people do you know who are consumed by football, but have no association with any team? Benitez is right about Gill, just as Ferguson was right about Dein. 

Stewart, however, is merely caught in the crossfire. After all, since when did football start listening to fans?
