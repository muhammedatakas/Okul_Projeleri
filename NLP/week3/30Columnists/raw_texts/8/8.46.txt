The people at UK Athletics are upset that I doubted their motivation to catch cheats in the light of the revelations in Dwain Chambers' autobiography. Chambers says the authorities know that athletes load up with illegal stimulants in the close season, October, November and December, yet in that period testing drops off. I find that strange, too.
So UKA released figures in an attempt to counter this allegation. Here they are: 

2007 - 674 in and out-of competition tests; 93 out-of-competition tests in October, November and December.
2008 April to December - 749 in and out-of-competition tests; 107 out-of-competition tests in October, November and December. 
Now I was never the best at mathematics in school, but I cannot find a single statistic there that makes Chambers wrong.
Claire Furlong, head of communications at UKA, says that the body are world leaders in their commitment to drugfree sport. She adds that Chambers met UK Sport, not the UKA, to spell out how to catch cheats, but surely there is discussion between the groups?
And if so, and knowing what we know, how come just 14 per cent of tests are conducted in the time when it has been spelled out that the cheats will be most active and most vulnerable to detection?
Still, at least we are able to correct Chambers on one point. He put close season tests at 15 per cent, the lunatic.
