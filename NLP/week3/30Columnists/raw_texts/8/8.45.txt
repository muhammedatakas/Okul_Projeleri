THERE was something quite poetic in John Dyson, the West Indies coach, being undone by his cynical attempt to manipulate the circumstances around the first one-day international in Guyana.
By calling his players off for bad light, in the mistaken belief that West Indies were a fraction ahead using the inscrutable Duckworth-Lewis method, Dyson betrayed his sport and those who follow it by denying the crowd what promised to be a grandstand finish.
His humiliation on discovery that he had miscalculated and handed the game to England was well deserved.
Having said that, any method of deciding the winner of a sports event that cannot be unravelled without recourse to a logarithm chart, a pocket calculator and two sets of toes is not much of a method at all.
