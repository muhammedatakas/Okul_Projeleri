The Women's Tennis Association are big on the equality of the sexes; of the races, not so much. 

The Dubai Tennis Championships are going ahead despite Shahar Peer, an Israeli player currently ranked 48th in the world, being refused entry to the United Arab Emirates. 


Ostensibly, this is because organisers feared protests over the situation in Gaza, as happened recently when Peer (pictured right) played in a tournament in New Zealand. 

In reality, the UAE only admits Israelis with dual nationality unless there are exceptional circumstances. Incredibly, this has been tolerated in sport before. Some Premier League clubs have even visited the region on a mid-season break and left Israeli squad members at home. 

The WTA stance is despicable. Dubai tournament organisers said they were worried about a boycott of the event by supporters if Peer played, but they should have been more concerned about a boycott of players and the instant disappearance of their fixture from the calendar, if the WTA had any teeth. 

Larry Scott, the WTA chief executive, says his body are considering sanctions which could see the Dubai championships removed from the tour in 2010. Too little, too late. 

When the ill-conceived plan for the 39th Premier League game was announced, Richard Scudamore, the chief executive, was asked if bids would be considered from countries that did not recognise Israeli passports. He admitted not previously considering that eventuality, but the answer was 'no'. 

That is the thinking time required to solve the problem of Peer pressure: five seconds. Shame on the WTA for taking longer.
