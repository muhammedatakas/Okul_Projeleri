Graham Thorpe, the former England batsman, knew how Kevin Pietersen could work his way back into the affections of players and public. ‘He has to prove he is the best player in the world,’ he said. Simple, isn’t it? 

Yet, surely this was the problem from the start. The best player rarely makes the best captain. Too self absorbed, too pressured, too focused on making the difference. Either the captaincy suffers, or the individual does.
 
Pietersen knew what was best for him — and it was certainly not Peter Moores — but he did not know what was best for his team.
That is why he misjudged their opinions.
By contrast, Mike Atherton was a fine England captain,but admitted in his autobiography the personal cost.
‘I was totally preoccupied with everything but my own game,’ he said.
‘As pressure increased, my ability to cope decreased. I needed time to put my game in order and the captaincy was a hindrance.’
Atherton’s batting carried England. Michael Vaughan’s, too. 

Freddie Flintoff and Pietersen are the life blood of this team now. 

Why saddle the match-winner with the crushing responsibility of captaincy?
Andrew Strauss is an altogether wiser choice. A very important player, yes, but not one on whom success turns. At least hemight be able to think straight.
