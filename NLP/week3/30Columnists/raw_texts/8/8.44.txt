SIR Tom Finney's all-time great England team, selected in this newspaper last week, did not contain a single player who won a cap beyond 1959. Not even Bobby Moore, the World Cupwinning captain.
Neil Franklin (pictured right) was one of Finney's central defenders, which is ironic considering the debate about pampered modern footballers, versus the salt-of-the-earth heroes of yesteryear.
Franklin was an England regular who, in 1950, turned his back on the maximum wage of £12 a week with Stoke City to earn four times as much playing for Sante Fe in the rebel Colombian league. The move soured quickly and when Franklin (pictured) returned home he was banned for half of the next season, sold to Hull City in Division Two, and never played for England again. He ended up traipsing from Crewe Alexandra to Stockport County, and, after a brief spell as manager of Colchester United, retired from football to run the Dog and Doublet pub in Sandon, Staffordshire.
These, we are led to believe, were the good old days, before greedy players spoiled the game. Funnily enough, we rarely read about the greedy owners from Finney's time, with 70,000 people in the ground paying to watch stars earning less than 10 quid. All that has happened subsequently is that the wealth chart has been redrawn to favour those doing the real work.
Had Franklin been playing today, he would not have been better off in Bogota and we might have seen the best of him.
