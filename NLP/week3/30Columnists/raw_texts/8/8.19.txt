The FA, a body who seem unable to work out whether they have rules on serious issues such as third party interference, are only too quick to launch investigations into other areas of the game: gambling, for instance.

Weymouth lost 9-0 at home to Rushden and Diamonds in the Blue Square Premier on Saturday, a result that is less surprising considering that Weymouth’s first team had gone on strike over pay and health insurance and their places were taken by the youth team (who, presumably, work for nothing and are dispensable).

As news of Weymouth’s predicament began to leak out on Friday afternoon, word of a potential betting coup spread. Rushden were backed in from 13-8 to 8-13, which is still very generous in the circumstances.

 
To a punter seeking an edge it would have been like buying money. Betfair traded £727,000 on the match, 10 times more than usual. Coral lost £100,000.

Now the FA are investigating. This is ridiculous.

Weymouth’s youngsters, with 17-year-old Joe Prodomo in goal, did not lose because the fix was in; they lost because they were boys against men. Their fans gave them a standing ovation after their defeat, without question they were trying.

The increase in wagers was symptomatic of rumours of a good thing going, quickly spreading around a small town.

Logically, there would be cause for alarm only if fortunes had been wagered on Weymouth’s kids, who had then won the match. Even if some of the Betfair money was laid by followers, even employees, of Weymouth, this is no different from getting good information from inside the stable.

The fans are fed up, the players have not been paid and the club are £300,000 in debt and facing oblivion.

It doesn’t make it right but, honestly, would you blame them?
