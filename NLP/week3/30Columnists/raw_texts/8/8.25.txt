Well, a week has passed and the Football Association still do not appear in a position to rule on the legality of Matthew Spring’s transfer from Luton Town to Charlton Athletic, which included a third party agreement saying he could not play in the FA Cup against Sheffield United, where he had been on loan.
In the meantime, Charlton did find a team that Spring is allowed to play against, Crystal Palace, who are Sheffield United’s rivals for promotion, and he helpfully scored the only goal of the game. 

It was Charlton’s first league win since October 4 and afterwards, Phil Parkinson, the Charlton manager, was generous in his praise for Kevin Blackwell,manager of Sheffield United, whose help facilitated Spring’s deal.
 
‘We had a gentleman’s agreement with Kev that we wouldn’t play him if we met in the FA Cup,’ he said. 

‘I see it that he was fresh for tonight, so I thank Kev for putting in that agreement.’
One problem. 

As nice as it was of Kev to insert an agreement in Spring’s transfer, Kev is not an employee of Luton Town, the selling club holding his registration, or Charlton Athletic, the buying club now in possession of it.
This makes him what is known as a third party. Fact.
And Parkinson has admitted that by taking Spring out of the FA Cup tie, in his opinion it left the player fresher for a match against a team that is rivalling Sheffield United for promotion. 

As explained last week, the Football League have no rules governing third party influence, but the FA do.
So why the delay? Or have the governing body mysteriously lost their appetite for such matters?
