When Burnley contacted the Football League over Jermain Defoe’s eligibility to have played for Tottenham Hotspur in the second leg of their Carling Cup semi-final, they received an interesting explanation.
Despite the base camp established on the high moral ground by Lord Mawhinney, the Football League chairman, the organisation have no firm regulation governing player registration and two-leg cup ties.
Defoe had not completed his signing from Portsmouth when the first match was played and Burnley, understandably, believed this constituted the start of a tie in which progress was measured by aggregate score and away goals could be taken into account. 
It would be like signing a player at half-time and getting him out for the second half. 

Not so, apparently.
As the Football League have no definitive regulations in place to administer two-leg matches, they rule that if a player is registered for league action, he is registered for the Carling Cup. 

 
When a colleague of  mine queried this stance last week, and asked where it was documented, he was told it was a silent rule. 

You may wonder if I am making this up. 

I’ll confess, sometimes I wonder whether I am making this stuff up, whether it is all a dream, like Alice In Wonderland.
Silent rules do seem the sort of thing the Queen of Hearts might have invented for a game of flamingo croquet after all, and Lord Mawhinney is very keen on screaming football’s equivalent of ‘off with their heads’ at his terrified clubs, by ordering giant points deductions for technical infringements or going into administration. 

‘We’re all mad here,’as the Cheshire Cat says.
But, no, it is true, the Football League have a silent rulebook for the sort of eventuality when their noisy one is found to have a huge rabbit-hole in the middle, through which all logic disappears.
Mawhinney, like Lewis Carroll, is making it up as he goes along.
