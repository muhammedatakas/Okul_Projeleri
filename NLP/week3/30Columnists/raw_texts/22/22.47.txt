After months of speculation the Wasps players James Haskell and Danny Cipriani have resolved their playing futures. Haskell has agreed a lucrative two-year deal with Stade Français while Wasps will announce on Tuesday that Cipriani has signed a one-year contract extension with them. The 23-year-old Haskell will be joined across the Channel next season by his England squad team-mates Riki Flutey and Tom Palmer as the wealthier Top 14 clubs flex their financial muscles.

While Haskell's switch to Stade has yet to be confirmed, sources in France say the deal is worth around £700,000. The 23-year-old flanker's departure will represent a watershed in the professional English game. A number of England players have previously opted to play in France but none has been an established first-choice international at the time. The selection of Brive's Andy Goode, however, has already set a precedent in terms of overseas-based individuals representing the national side under Martin Johnson.

Haskell chose not to comment today but negotiations with Wasps are now believed to have run their course. Palmer is also heading for Stade, while Flutey is on the verge of a move to Brive, where Goode, Steve Thompson and Ben Cohen are in residence.

The trend has considerable implications for the Rugby Football Union and the leading English clubs. Players who are based outside the Premiership fall outside the agreement that was struck between the RFU and Premier Rugby and would be ­available for England only in the week immediately prior to a Test match. Cipriani, however, has decided to stay put despite interest from a number of clubs at home and abroad. Tom Rees is also due to be confirmed as Wasps' new captain.
