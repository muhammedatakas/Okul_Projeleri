As many as two in five of us think that local authorities and public transport have done a good job of handling the recent snowstorms and bad weather, according to the latest Populus poll for The Times. 

The poll, undertaken over the weekend after the worst snow in England for 18 years, shows a surprising degree of tolerance for the plight of public authorities. This is highest in the South East, which normally does not receive much snow and experienced unusually severe disruption for a few days. 

Exactly 40 per cent agree that “considering how rarely Britain has such heavy snowfall, local authorities, public transport and emergency services have done a good job of handling the bad weather and its effects”. There are sharp social contrasts: a half of professionals and managers (51 per cent) agree, but the same can be said of only a third (33 per cent) of unskilled manual workers. Just over a half of Labour voters (52 per cent) are in agreement, but only 42 per cent of Conservatives. 

Nonetheless, nearly three fifths of the public (58 per cent) believe “it is ridiculous that a few inches of snow brought Britain to a standstill when other countries successfully keep going in much worse weather conditions and our local authorities, public transport and emergency services should have been better prepared”. Just under a half of professionals and managers (47 per cent) agree, rising to two thirds (66 per cent) of unskilled workers. 
In general, criticism of public authorities is highest in the badly hit Midlands (62 per cent) and Wales and the South West (66 per cent), and lowest in the South East (53 per cent).
