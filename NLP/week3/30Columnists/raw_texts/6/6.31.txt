Perception is all. The key principle for anyone in public life, whether a politician, civil servant or journalist, is what something would look like if it became public. Could it be defended? Only self-flagellating puritans or hermits would say that there should be no social contacts at all. What matters is the scale. 

Moreover, journalists should be wary of being self-righteous since they enjoy as well as offer hospitality, which is part of their daily business. I do not know of a single politician or senior civil servant whose conduct is likely to be changed by a meal or a drink. 

Much of the contact is innocuous. After all, senior civil servants are encouraged to get out of their departments to meet people in their sectors. That is part of their jobs. But hospitality is much less significant than the revolving doors by which some civil servants, often below permanent secretary level, leave to work in the sectors that they have monitored. 

The Civil Service Code lays down very general principles about not being “seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity”. 

This puts the onus on the civil servants, and the pattern of reporting revealed yesterday suggests that individuals have interpreted the rules in different ways.
