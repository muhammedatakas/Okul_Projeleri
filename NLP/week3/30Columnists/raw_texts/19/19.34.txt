Members of the Britannia building society are likely to miss out on their annual dividend as it faces mounting losses on its portfolio of buy-to-let and property lending.

The society, the largest mutual lender after the Nationwide, wrote off more than £40m of bad debts at its subsidiary Capital Investment Group (CIG), which carries out its specialist lending, in the six months to June. Banking experts believe that the continued slump in the housing market - Nationwide last week reported that prices are falling at their fastest since the early 1990s - and commercial property market will mean that more write-offs will be needed this year.

CIG's profits fund Britannia's membership reward, which totalled £46m in 2007. But the write-offs meant that the business made just £7.9m profit in the first half of the year and that could disappear in the second half.

Hank Calenti, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: 'Its exposure to commercial real estate and specialist residential lending is nothing short of alarming for what should be a staid building society.'

A Britannia spokesman said the society had never offered mortgages for more than the value of the property and that its commercial property interests were 'low risk'. He said: 'We never funded speculative development; we only lent if there was already a tenant and our biggest tenant is the government.'

He said the society was well financed, with 90 per cent of the lending in its core retail business funded from deposits. It has been benefiting from the flight from banks like Bradford & Bingley and HBOS and has taken in £10m a day in deposits over the last month.
