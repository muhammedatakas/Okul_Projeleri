Multi-millionaire Barclays executive Roger Jenkins is exempt from the bank's decision to scrap bonuses for its top bosses, it has emerged. Jenkins, believed to be the most highly paid man at the bank, is the architect of a controversial £5.8bn capital raising from Middle Eastern investors, which will be voted on by shareholders tomorrow.

John Varley, the chief executive, and executive directors Bob Diamond, Chris Lucas and Frits Seegers will forgo their 2008 bonus payouts. Jenkins, who is not included in the 'no bonus' pledge because he does not sit on the main board, could be in line for his biggest payday. His remuneration is believed to be higher than Diamond's £25m haul last year.

The bank is expected to win approval for its plan to raise cash from Qatar and Abu Dhabi on more expensive terms than it could have had from the UK government, despite widespread discontent.

Shareholders will be reluctant to vote down the deal because that would undermine the value of their investment. A significant proportion are likely to abstain, but the bank is still expected to garner enough reluctant 'yes' votes. However, bank sources expressed fears that the scheme might still be thwarted. 'I wouldn't bet my house on it,' said one. 

Leading shareholder Legal & General, which will cast its vote in favour, remains critical. Peter Chambers, chief executive of its investment arm, said: 'We regret that Barclays decided to raise capital from a small group of strategic investors without due consideration of its impact on existing shareholders and on terms that we consider to be expensive.'
