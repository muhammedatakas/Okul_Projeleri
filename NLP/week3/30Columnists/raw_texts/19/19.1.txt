The Association of British Insurers (ABI) is proposing regulations to safeguard against investors losing money on savings in supposedly safe cash funds.

The proposals follow revelations that cash funds offered by insurers such as Standard Life, Prudential and Clerical Medical suffered significant losses because of their holdings in risky instruments like mortgage debt and other asset-backed securities. 

Many investors use these funds as an alternative to holding large cash balances in their pension funds in the run-up to retirement, when they are looking for secure investments.

The ABI is consulting on proposals for a new category of money market fund with protection of capital as its main objective. Permitted instruments would include bank deposits, certificates of deposit and commercial paper; asset-backed securities - the key instruments behind the current problems - would be excluded. 

The losses have arisen because many funds were trying to add a little extra to their yields, rather than focusing on conserving the value of the investments. Standard Life, whose £2.4bn Pension Sterling fund dropped 5% virtually overnight, eventually agreed to compensate its 97,000 investors for their losses. Other firms have not, so far, followed suit. 

There are about 300 money market funds operated by insurers but the ABI does not know how many might move across to the new sector. The consultation period will run until 8 May.

Fund manager members including Henderson and Fidelity of the Investment Management Association also offer money market funds. Five of the 33 funds in this sector lost money over the last year. The IMA is conducting a review of the sector and proposals are expected soon.
