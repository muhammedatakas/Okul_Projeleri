More than a fifth of the money market funds available to retail investors, promoted as a safe alternative to cash, have lost money over the last three months - and experts warn there could be further pain to come.

The worst performer is the Threadneedle UK Money Securities Fund, which has lost almost 5 per cent over the last three months, according to figures from Morningstar. Two funds offered by Prudential, a further two from F&C and one from M&G have also lost between 0.1 and 2 per cent.

These are some of the new breed of 'cash plus funds', which aimed to offer a small premium above the rates from cash deposits by investing in areas such as asset-backed securities - credit cards, mortgages and other loans which are parcelled up and sold to investors - and certificates of deposit. Their value has plunged since the financial crisis took hold and there could be further falls.

Threadneedle's fund, for example, has a third of its assets in asset-backed floating-rate notes. A spokesman said that these had started to recover after the various government bail-outs of banks, but 'the deteriorating economic background which has affected all markets has impacted the recovery, which in turn has affected the fund's recent performance'.

F&C's Sterling Enhanced Cash fund - which has lost 1 per cent in the last month alone - is almost 50 per cent invested in asset-backed securities. It changed its pricing basis in the summer, following a dramatic drop in its value, compensating some investors who had lost out, but its performance remains poor.

Tony Andrews, manager of the Henderson Cash fund - which has made 1.13 per cent in the last month - said: 'The rational investor has to be confident with the portfolio they are buying. For certain types of asset, questions need to be asked.' His fund has never invested in asset-backed securities and other riskier instruments.
