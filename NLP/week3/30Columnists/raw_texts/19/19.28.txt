Fears that insurers could be the next victims of the financial crisis were heightened last night by a warning that many major players had a 'capital cushion' of around £1bn that could be seriously eroded if financial markets deteriorate over the next few months.

Roman Cizdyn, insurance analyst at Blue Oar Securities, says 'currently, the capital cushion is comfortable, but only if we don't go to a worse place than where we are already'.

Share prices of insurers fell sharply last week with Aviva and Prudential slumping 20 per cent.

Cizdyn says the sell-off reflects concern that insurance companies have large holdings in corporate bonds, where prices have fallen, as well as equities, which have been hit hard by the banking meltdown. They also have holdings in the bombed-out commercial property sector. He declined to specify which insurers were more vulnerable than others.

The Pru and Aviva have scotched rumours that they may be forced to launch rights issues to bolster their solvency ratios. Prudential will update investors on its capital position on Tuesday. Aviva's finance director Philip Scott has warned that a £1bn windfall for Norwich Union (owned by Aviva) with-profits policyholders announced in July could be cut if turbulent market conditions persist.

'If equity markets are significantly lower at the time of the scheme being implemented, the payments could be less than they otherwise would have been,' he said.

Policyholders are expected to get details of the offer - which was estimated at an average of £1,000 per policyholder - next summer.
