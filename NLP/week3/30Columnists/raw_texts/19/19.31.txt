Beleaguered high street banks are planning to rewrite their executive pay policies in a bid to restore their reputations in the wake of the £400m government bail-out of their businesses.

Politicians from the three main political parties have called for curbs on the excessive executive pay and City bonuses that are deemed partly responsible for the debt spiral that ended with a bang as stock markets plummeted across the globe. Gordon Brown said last week: 'The days of big bonuses are over.'

Barclays - whose president Bob Diamond claimed a package worth £18.1m in 2007 - is believed to be reviewing its directors' pay arrangements. Royal Bank of Scotland - whose chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin picked up £4.2m last year - said it would look at both executive pay and bonuses in the financial trading rooms where the problems originated.

'It's clear there is going to be a quid-pro-quo' between the government's support package and pay curbs, a spokeswoman said. 

A survey by the Guardian found that the chief executives of the five largest banks were paid almost £65m over the last five years and their pay has risen far faster than inflation.

RBS, Barclays, LloydsTSB and HBOS are locked in negotiations with the government over how much of the £25bn available to strengthen their capital they will take up and on what terms. The government is insisting that the industry strengthen its capital ratios by 1 per centage point to qualify for a guarantee on up to £250bn of inter-bank lending.
