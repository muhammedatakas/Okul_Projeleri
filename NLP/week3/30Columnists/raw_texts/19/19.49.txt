Banking giant HBOS is bracing itself for a poor take-up of its £4bn rights issue amid growing gloom in the housing and banking markets.

Experts say that the hope of mergers or takeovers of weaker players like Bradford & Bingley, which helped its share price last week, are likely to prove over-optimistic.

Most private client brokers are advising HBOS's retail investors, who own more than a quarter of its shares, to ignore the rights issue. Its shares traded below the 275p rights price for most of last week, closing on Friday at 270p, which means many institutional investors are also likely to shun the cash call.

While HBOS is guaranteed to get its money as the issue is fully underwritten, a low take-up would mean that the sub-underwriters would be left with a large rump of stock which they will be anxious to offload, which could depress the price still further. 

B&B is set to get approval for its third attempt at raising £400m at a shareholder meeting on Thursday after abandoning two previous efforts following a profits warning and a ratings downgrade, which prompted strategic investor TPG to pull out.

B&B's shares are also trading well below their 55p rights price - they closed on Friday at 47.75p - despite speculation that they could attract a bidder. The Share Centre is urging private investors to sell even at these depressed levels as the market could get worse.

But one banking executive pointed out that, although it is valued at less than £300m, it has £40bn of mortgage assets which would have to be financed by a bidder. 'In these markets, it would be a big call to find that amount of capital.'

James Hamilton, banking analyst at Numis Secuirities said the market is 'almost certain to continue getting worse'. He believes all British banks could make losses next year as the housing gloom spreads to other industries.
