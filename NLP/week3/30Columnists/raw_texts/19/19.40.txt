Unions are demanding urgent meetings with Eric Daniels and Andy Hornby, the chief executives of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, as fears grow over the future of the newly merged bank's 140,000 workers.

Unite joint general secretary Derek Simpson has written to the pair to say he will meet them 'at any time'. Simpson is concerned that four days after the merger was agreed, no effort has been made to contact unions. 'Every merger, unions always get a call. But we've had no information,' said a Unite source. 'It's been an exceptional week: we understand that. But tens of thousands of workers are going into this weekend not knowing whether they will have a job.'

At least 14,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the creation of Britain's biggest bank. Unite has tabled an emergency resolution at this week's Labour conference, urging the government to undertake a fundamental review of banking regulation. A groundswell of opinion within the Labour party suggests there will be strong backing for the motion.

Eric Daniels, chief executive of Lloyds TSB, said he expected the banks' £13bn merger with rival HBOS to give a significant boost to revenues, in addition to the promised £1bn of cost cuts.

In an interview with The Observer, he said he believed its 'comprehensive branch coverage would serve customers extremely well'. 

However, analysts warn that as many as 500 Lloyds branches could be closed. There are also fears that some of its brands may disappear - Lloyds uses Cheltenham & Gloucester for its mortgages, and owns Scottish Widows, which competes with HBOS's Clerical Medical - while the two banks already have a big overlap of customers.
