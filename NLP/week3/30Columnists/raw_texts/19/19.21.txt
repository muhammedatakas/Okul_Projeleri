Barclays bosses will hold another round of meetings with shareholders this week in a bid to persuade them to support its proposal to raise £7bn from two Middle Eastern investors.

The meetings come amid intensifying opposition to the plans, which existing shareholders say are far too generous to the new investors. Last week the Association of British Insurers and voting advisory service RREV both questioned the terms of the deal. 

'The cost of the proposed funding package... is very substantial and is in the opinion of some shareholders unfavourable compared with the terms offered to other UK banks from the Treasury,' said the Association of British Insurers, which also gave it an 'amber top' rating, indicating serious concerns.

RREV recommended that its subscribers abstain from voting on the proposal at its EGM on 24 November. 

Barclays argues that bringing in these strategic shareholders is preferable to joining the government's support package, as that would expose it to state controls over its business as well as restricting its ability to pay dividends and bonuses to its investment banking staff. 

It also believes that the relationship with its new shareholders - the Qatar Investment Authority and Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan - who owns Manchester City - will bring in new clients and business deals.

But investors say the government has made it clear it has no plans to 'micro-manage' the three banks which are participating in its refinancing package. RBS and Lloyds have also said they will resume dividend payments within two years.
