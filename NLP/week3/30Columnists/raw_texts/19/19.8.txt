Fears are growing that Lloyds Banking Group may need more public money, possibly leading to full nationalisation, after it revealed that newly acquired HBOS made far higher losses than the City expected.

Encouraged by the government, Lloyds acquired HBOS last year. It is now clear that HBOS would have needed to have been taken over by the state, as Northern Rock was, if not for the Lloyds tie-up. The merged group is already 43% owned by the taxpayer.

Angry shareholders are demanding Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels tell them why he failed to fully investigate HBOS's accounts before agreeing a takeover of the ailing bank. 

Lloyds stunned the City on Friday when it warned that HBOS made a loss of almost £11bn in 2008, after recording around £7bn of write-offs in its corporate division. 

That sparked fury among investors, many of whom had questioned whether Daniels should have gone ahead with the acquisition. 

They are particularly angry about Daniels's admission to the Treasury select committee that he did just a third to a fifth as much "due diligence" - checking the books - than is normal before an acquisition of this size.

"On the basis that he must have known about the announcement, it was clumsy at best to suggest that he did inadequate due diligence," said one leading shareholder. "That puts the spotlight on Daniels. People are clearly going to focus on why it had to be so rushed."
