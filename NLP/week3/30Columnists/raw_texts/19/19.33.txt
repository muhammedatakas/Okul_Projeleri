Prudential is eyeing the Asian business that has been put up for sale by AIG, the US insurance giant, following its bail-out by the government last month.

AIG confirmed on Friday that it planned to concentrate on its property and casualty general insurance business in the US and would also 'retain a continuing ownership' of its international life company, which is one of the largest players in the Asian market. 

But sell-offs from within this company, and from its life operations in the US, are needed to repay up to $85bn (£48bn) borrowings from the US government.

Prudential rivals AIG in Asia and it is keen to expand in the region, which is one of the fastest-growing markets for life and investment products. But it is likely to face stiff competition from rivals such as Aviva, which is also looking to expand in Asia, and European insurers such as Allianz, Axa and ING.

But AIG has given no more details of whether it plans to sell a stake in the whole global business, or offload some parts. It is the leading foreign player in countries such as China, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, according to research by Cazenove, which also values the entire business at $22bn.
