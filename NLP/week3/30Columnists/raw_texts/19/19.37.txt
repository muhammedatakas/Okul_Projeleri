The heads of five of America's biggest banking failures have collected compensation worth more than $300m (£162m) between them - a figure that bolsters the political pressure for a curb on executive pay as part of the proposed $700bn deal to rid the banks of toxic assets.

The biggest winner was Stan O'Neal, who kept more than $160m when he was ousted from Merrill Lynch last autumn. Earlier this month, his bank was forced into a merger with Bank of America.

It is believed Countrywide Financial chief Angelo Mozilo got $115m when he left the mortgage firm, which is under investigation for mis-selling loans, after it was also acquired by Bank of America. Mozilo is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over his exercise of $141m of share options just before the bank's share price collapsed; he denies any wrongdoing.

Chuck Prince took more than $30m after he departed from Citigroup in 2007, while Martin Sullivan was paid $14m in compensation when he lost his job as chief executive of AIG. Wachovia boss Ken Thompson took $1.45m and $7.25m of shares when he left in the summer. The bank's shares have collapsed as it struggles to find a suitor.
